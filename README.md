About:
The program acts as a classifier for a dataset containing both facial and non-facial images. The program uses Haar Cascade from OpenCV library to detect and extract faces from facial images of the input dataset and store them in a folder. All non-facial images are stored in a different folder. The extracted faces can then be used to train a neural network for face recognition.

The project has been undertaken for the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of degree of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering under the guidance of Mr. Pankaj Badoni (Assistant Professor, CIT-UPES). 

The program has been written completely in C language with minor tweaks and is in .cpp extn as VC++ 11.0 has been used for compilation.
